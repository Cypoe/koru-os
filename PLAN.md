# PLAN — koru-os, free-standing

The destination: **koru-os is a free-standing OS**, not a Unikraft unikernel
with extras. Unikraft and KolibriOS are *donors* — reusable substrate,
drivers, ABIs, behavior — and Hyprland/Quickshell/Noctalia are *oracles*
(conformance references), not the host.

## What is owned (non-negotiable, koru-native)

| layer | owns |
|---|---|
| identity | `nid` — object pins + correspondence rows; nids are resolvable references, not names |
| seams | syscall seam, provider dispatch, spawn/exec, rights bags |
| realization | `std/realize` vocabulary + `koruos/realize` policy — rows bind arms, loudly or not at all |
| views | POSIX paths, the relational store, the SAS-silo memory model |

## What can stay extern (donor or oracle)

- **Drivers** — extern is fine. What must be owned is the *provider contract*
  they plug into, not the register-poking.
- **Userland / programs** — shells, compositors, apps can be extern code
  (even Hyprland before `nativeCompositor` exists) — as long as they ride
  koru-os seams, not the other way around.
- **Memory internals** — extern allocators are acceptable; the owned part is
  the model: **single-address-space silos that virtual memory maps onto**
  (a silo is the object; VM/CR3 is a projection of it).
- **Filesystem internals** — extern fs implementations are acceptable; the
  owned part is **relational object storage underneath, POSIX as a view**.
  Paths are projections over nid-pinned identity — `lookup`/`pin`/`exec-nid`
  already prove the direction on ext2.

## Donors

| source | role | state |
|---|---|---|
| `upstream/unikraft` (+ koru-libs `unikraft/*`) | provider dataset, driver ABI, arm `unikraft/*` | vendored, actively used |
| `upstream/kolibrios` | second donor: fasmg source, drivers, full GUI stack — not yet mined | vendored, unstudied |
| Hyprland / Quickshell / Noctalia (`m9src/*`) | compositor+shell **oracle** — behavior reference for `nativeCompositor` | pinned |

### The open ABI question (decide before driver count grows)

Today the lifts speak Unikraft's ABI (`uk_blkdev_*`, `ukplat_*`,
`uk_alloc`) and the native provider *implements* that ABI in
`koru/native/*.zig`. Two honest options:

- **(a)** keep `uk_*` as a private ABI forever — legitimate; an ABI is
  just an ABI, and unikraft stays a first-class arm.
- **(b)** define `koruos.blk.*` (etc.) as the owned provider contract and
  make unikraft an *adapter* onto it — the honest "not a unikernel"
  answer, and a re-plumb of every lift extern. Every new driver added
  under (a) makes (b) more expensive.

Same question applies to fasmg/KolibriOS material: KolibriOS is a
full GUI OS in flat assembler; its syscall ABI (int 0x40), driver model,
and VFS are donor-shaped — an adapter arm, not a substrate to inherit.

## Landed (koru-native arm, gated by `scripts/check-boot.sh` — 16/16)

- multiboot2/PVH boot, 32→64 trampoline, COM1 serial, TSC clock
- 8259 PIC + IDT + exception delivery; interrupt-driven virtio-blk
  completion (`hlt` parks on vectors, no burn loops)
- PIT tick preemption: per-child frames + CR3, round-robin roster of ≤4
  ring-3 ELF64 children, in-place ISR-frame rewrite
- `SYSCALL`/`SYSRET` seam with rights bags (NR bitmask today)
- ext2: mount/create/verify/fetch — **path as projection over inode
  identity** (`dirFind`/`lookupPath`/`lookup`); `exec(path)` folds
  walk→inode→ELF→spawn; `pin`/`exec-nid` run a child *by identity*
- nid: correspondence-row Table (open/resolve/probe/call/retarget) +
  arm-provided object-pin store (`koruos_nid_obj_pin/key` in
  `runtime.zig`)

## Open axes (dependency order)

```
frame allocator + page reclaim + teardown        (heap is a 4MiB bump; free is a no-op)
  → wait queues + kernel-as-context + per-task kstacks + FPU state
    → syscall surface + nid-scoped grant bags (replaces NR bitmask)
      → fs.object iface + nid dispatch; fs writes/dirs/indirects
        → input + display (virtio-gpu | GOP), PCI enum + MSI-X, ACPI
          → init/shell/process userland (fork/exec, pipes/IPC)
            → nativeCompositor + Hyprland/Noctalia oracle harness
```

Also open, smaller:

- pins as Table *rows* (generation/retarget/stale-on-use for object ids),
  pin leasing + eviction
- `exec(nid)` resolving the provider from the pin itself (no caller-held fs)
- rename/unlink/link/`..`/`.` so "identity survives the view" is provable
- bootable media: GRUB multiboot2 image (link.ld already carries the
  header), init that doesn't halt-on-exit, shutdown/reboot
- SMP (ACPI MADT + IOAPIC + AP bringup) — required before real hardware
- KolibriOS study: driver model, int 0x40 ABI surface, GUI/windowing
  architecture — what's liftable vs what stays donor-shaped

## Not doing (explicit)

- Not embedding Hyprland as the native host — it's the oracle.
- Not making POSIX the primary ontology — it's a view over the
  relational/identity layer.
- Not shipping a fake compositor to claim the milestone early.
